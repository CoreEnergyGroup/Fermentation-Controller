  <p>PID Setting Usage Guide 

    The controller has two separate PID controllers, Main and Heat.  All control
    Is done in degrees Celsius regardless of the user preference for Celsius or Fahrenheit.  
    Main controls the target temperature for the chamber to maintain the beer
    Target temperature.  
    Main Kp:  Setting represents degrees to move chamber target per degree of beer error from
    Target setting.   10 is a good starting point.  
    
    Main Ki:  Setting represents degrees to move chamber target per second per degree beer target
    Error.  0.0005 is a good starting point.
    
    Main Kd:  Setting represents degrees to move chamber target per change in error per second.
    0 is a good starting point disabling any derivative action.  
    
    Heat controls the % output to the heating element (between 0% and 100%) when the controller is
    In heat mode to maintain the chamber temperature target.  
    
    Heat Kp:  Setting represents % to move heat setting per degree of chamber error from
    Target output of main PID.   30 is a good starting point.  
    
    Heat Ki:  Setting represents % to move heat setting per second per degree chamber error from
    Target output of main PID Error.  0.0002 is a good starting point.
    
    Heat Kd:  Setting represents % to move heat setting per change in error per second.
    0 is a good starting point disabling any derivative action.  </p>
